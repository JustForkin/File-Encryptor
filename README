Introduction
===================
This repository contains code to encrypt and decrypt any file into an already existing image. The decryptor only decrypts images encrypted by the given encryptor. The images that are used are PNG files because they store 4 color channels, and are the most common types online.
===================
Instructions
===================
To use, simply make a new directory, move in the file to convert, the image file, and the two class files, and use the following commands:

To Encrypt:
java FileEncryptor filename pngfilename outputfilename
To Decrypt:
java FileDecryptor encryptedfilename outputfilename
